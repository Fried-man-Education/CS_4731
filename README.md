# Georgia Tech's CS 4731 - Game AI (Summer 2023)
## Course Description
Artificial Intelligence as applied to video game development, is a bit different than general AI research. This is due to the fact that general AI is often concerned with finding a correct and/or optimal answer. However, the goal of Game AI is to simply provide a fun gameplay experience. Because of this, Game AI solutions may involve cutting corners, tricking the game player, or otherwise cheating in regards to implementation. Game AI also faces the challenge of limited computational resources as video games involve a lot of subsystems that must work in coordination such as graphics, sound, physics simulation, etc. Game AI is often a lower priority in this list of game features and further motivates the corner cutting strategies.

While Game AI often leverages concepts from classic AI research, you will see that there are many unique implementation strategies for achieving a fun game play experience.
