Description:
This procedural content generation project uses Perlin Noise to create a complex, 
visually distinct terrain of mountains, hills, and canyons. The mountains are 
defined by pronounced ridges, generated using high frequency and high amplitude 
Perlin noise, providing a realistic and rugged landscape. The hills, conversely, 
are characterized by high grouping with mild divots for texture, achieved through 
lower frequency noise and carefully controlled amplitude, creating a smoothly varying, 
rolling terrain. Finally, the canyons are uniquely identified by a river bed forming 
at the bottom, with natural dams being slowly eroded - this is accomplished by 
generating sharp, profound changes in elevation using Perlin noise. The Perlin noise 
is manipulated with a hierarchy of rules and layered noise configurations to mimic 
the process of erosion and deposition. Thus, through strategic manipulation of Perlin 
noise parameters, we create three varied terrain features, emulating the natural 
world's complexity and diversity.
